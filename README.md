A lot of element is taken from from https://github.com/delay/flutter_firebase_auth_example, with modification (coming soon) :  
- username (instead of first/last name)
- anonymous sign in when user open the app for the first time
- The state management will be modified, from InheritedWidget to ChangeNotifierProvider
